## ⭐ State management

In this project, I have tried to use `useReducer` to centralize state logic instead of scattering states logic throughout different components.

In addition, complex state transitions are mapped to actions, which provides a more declarative way to update states.

Through this project, I realised that `useReducer` is ideal for multiple related pieces of state.
